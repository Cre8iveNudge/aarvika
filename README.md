## How It Works

1. **Start Meditation:** The app begins with a welcome screen where users can initiate the breathing session.
2. **Guided Session:** The breathing process is divided into stages (Inhale, Hold, Exhale), and animations dynamically reflect these phases.
3. **Cloud Animation:** Soft, drifting clouds provide a soothing backdrop, enhancing the relaxing atmosphere.
4. **End Screen:** Upon completion, users are congratulated and can either restart the session or return to the main screen.
5. **Affirmations:** Positive affirmations are displayed during the session to reinforce a sense of calm and well-being.
